  },
  {
    question: "What changed with the Wordcell name?",
    answer: "Only the product identity. The package is @hraness/wordcell and the command is wordcell, with kb kept as a deprecated alias through 0.20.x. The vault format keeps its kb names, so existing vaults need no migration.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need an embedding model?",
    answer: "No. Exact and keyword search work without one. Hybrid and semantic modes use a pinned local model through the optional QMD dependency, and the index is rebuildable from Markdown.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do agents use it?",
    answer: "Install the wordcell Agent Skill through skills.sh. It teaches Codex, Claude Code, and compatible agents to search, capture, plan, percolate, refresh, and validate a vault with the installed command.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is it published?",
    answer: "Each release is an immutable GitHub Release with a packing receipt, checksums, and signed provenance. The same archive bytes are published to npm from the tag workflow through OIDC trusted publishing.",
