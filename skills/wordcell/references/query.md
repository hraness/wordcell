# Query the knowledge base

Use the cheapest precise view first, then broaden. Markdown files remain the
authority; search scores, metadata rows, and graph results are derived views.

## Locate the vault

- Resolve `<vault>` to the directory containing its managed or authored `index.md`, then
  set the shell-local `KB_ROOT` to that path (`KB_ROOT=kb` from a typical
  repository root, or `KB_ROOT=.` from inside the vault).
- Resolve `<repository>` to the repository root when the question concerns a
  repository path (`KB_REPO=.` from that root).
- Read the vault's applicable agent instructions and note conventions.
- Pass the resolved path to every `--root`; do not scan a repository root merely
  because that is where the agent session started.

## Recover a stopped session

When the user asks to resume earlier work, begin with the path being changed.
Keep each retrieval signal separate so the agent can inspect why a record was
returned:

```sh
wordcell context packages/parser/src/index.ts --root "$KB_ROOT" --repo "$KB_REPO"
wordcell search "why parser retries stop" --root "$KB_ROOT" --mode exact \
  --history --repo "$KB_REPO" --json
wordcell backlinks notes/parser-contract --root "$KB_ROOT" --json
wordcell history notes/parser-contract --root "$KB_ROOT" \
  --repo "$KB_REPO" --json
```

Replace the example path, query, and note ID with values from the current task.
Read the inherited guides and authoritative Markdown returned by these views.
Use the backlink to inspect related plans and use Git history as provenance,
not as proof that the note remains correct. This workflow recovers only context
that was persisted in files or Git; it does not reconstruct private chat.

## Choose the retrieval lane

- Repository file or directory: run `wordcell context` first. Read its inherited
  guides root to nearest, then inspect its maintained knowledge, active plans,
  dated research, reports, and separate historical-plan group. Open only useful
  context hubs or records.
- Known frontmatter field or tag such as type, status, or area: use `wordcell list`.
- Known note title, path, or alias: use `wordcell links` or `wordcell backlinks`, which
  resolve note identities before returning authored relationships.
- A whole-vault structural question or relationship audit: use `wordcell graph --json`,
  then inspect the smallest relevant portion of its canonical output.
- A phrase, identity, or concept expressed with different vocabulary: use `wordcell search`, whose default hybrid result preserves exact and QMD evidence separately.
- Direct provenance for one note or repository path: use `wordcell history` or
  `wordcell history search` without changing authored metadata or links.
- Recent captures awaiting maintained disposition: use the advisory `wordcell inbox` view.
- Broad orientation: read `index.md`, then follow the smallest useful link trail. Use `wordcell catalog` when an exhaustive disposable inventory is actually needed.
- A question spanning registered vaults: use `wordcell portfolio search` with a reviewed registry and explicit authorization. Use `wordcell portfolio audit` to assess IDs, duplicate authority, links, attachments, and provenance without repairing content.

```sh
wordcell context src/parser.ts --root "$KB_ROOT" --repo "$KB_REPO"
wordcell list --root "$KB_ROOT" --scope src/parser --where type=plan --json
wordcell list --root "$KB_ROOT" --where type=plan --where status=in-progress --sort area --json
wordcell list --root "$KB_ROOT" --tag retrieval --sort title --json
wordcell backlinks "Plan title or path" --root "$KB_ROOT" --json
wordcell links "Plan title or path" --root "$KB_ROOT" --direction both --depth 1 --limit 25 --json
wordcell relation list "Plan title or path" --root "$KB_ROOT" --json
wordcell graph --root "$KB_ROOT" --json
wordcell search "why browser capture uses the current tab" --root "$KB_ROOT" --json
wordcell search "accepted ingestion plans" --root "$KB_ROOT" --where type=plan --where status=accepted --tag ingestion --json
wordcell search "notes/write-path" --root "$KB_ROOT" --mode exact --no-history --json
wordcell history "notes/write-path" --root "$KB_ROOT" --repo "$KB_REPO" --json
wordcell history search src/parser.ts --root "$KB_ROOT" --repo "$KB_REPO" --json
wordcell inbox --root "$KB_ROOT" --limit 25 --json
wordcell portfolio search "durable memory" --registry ./kb-portfolio.json --workspace .. --shared --json
wordcell portfolio audit --registry ./kb-portfolio.json --workspace .. --vault hraness/wordcell --vault 0thernet/jungle --strict --json
```

Portfolio selection is an access decision. Prefer repeated `--vault owner/id`
for deliberate private or personal scope. `--shared` selects only public and
organization entries; `--all` exists only for audit. One operation is bounded
to 32 vaults and never silently truncates a larger registry-derived selection.
Open returned notes before concluding. Cross-vault scores are not compared;
federation uses deterministic reciprocal local rank and stable logical IDs.

When a reviewed consumer policy needs repeatable query shorthand, pass a strict
v1 rules file. An alias is recognized only as the first token and can add a
query, mode, metadata filters, tags, or repository scopes without discarding
caller constraints. Priority ordering is a separate opt-in:

```sh
wordcell search "@active-plans parser" --root "$KB_ROOT" \
  --rules ./search-rules.json --priority --json
wordcell portfolio search "@active-plans parser" \
  --registry ./kb-portfolio.json --workspace .. --shared \
  --rules ./search-rules.json --priority --json
```

`--rules` alone enables aliases but retains relevance order. `--priority`
requires a rules file and requests `priority-then-relevance`; exact identities
still come first, and matching selected hits carry a rule trace. Keep this
policy beside the registry or repository that owns it. Rules do not grant
access, choose authority, author links, or mutate Markdown.

`wordcell context` prints hub and record summaries, not their bodies. Each record
states the exact `repository_scopes` declaration that matched, the match depth,
and whether that declaration currently names a file, directory, or absent
future or retired path. Current memory and terminal plans stay in separate
groups. Guides remain
the normative, always-loaded home for ownership, required commands,
prohibitions, invariants, and edit gates. Scope hubs are optional pull-based
rationale, history, examples, evidence, and links; they cannot override a guide
or become the only home of a load-bearing rule. Use `--kind file` or
`--kind directory` when `auto` cannot classify a missing target reliably.

Repeated filters use AND semantics. Metadata paths may be dotted. String and
tag comparisons are case-insensitive; array metadata matches by membership.
Missing sort values come last, with path as the deterministic tie-breaker.
`--where` addresses authored frontmatter only; it does not filter derived H1
titles or file paths. Unquoted `true`, `false`, `null`, and numeric filter
values are typed. Keep quotes inside the argument to match a string with the
same spelling, for example `--where 'external_id="9007199254740993"'`.
`--scope` is an exact, case-sensitive repository-scope filter rather than a
substring or area match. Use it when the desired authored path declaration is
known.

## Use hybrid search as discovery

`wordcell search` first scans current Markdown for identity, phrase, metadata, tag,
and prose matches. By default it runs that exact lane alongside QMD's local
full-text and vector rankings, then combines the ranked lists while retaining
each lane's evidence. Exact title and alias identities stay ahead of broader
matches. The QMD path avoids query expansion and reranking models by default.

The first hybrid or semantic query downloads QMD's compact local embedding
model; later queries reuse the local cache. Prewarm explicitly when useful:

```sh
wordcell index --root "$KB_ROOT"
```

Use `--mode exact` for live model-free search, `--mode keyword` for QMD
full-text retrieval, or `--mode semantic` for its vector lane. Repeated
`--where`, `--has`, and `--tag` constraints are checked against the live
Markdown snapshot. QMD has no path-allowlist search in the pinned release, so a
selective semantic query over-fetches a bounded global window and reports a
degraded partial lane when that window cannot prove completeness. Treat every
retrieval rank as a lead, not a fact. Open the returned Markdown, read enough
surrounding context, and confirm claims against linked sources or capture
manifests.

Default search also returns bounded explicit graph context around the strongest
results. Supply `--related <note>` to seed a known neighborhood or `--no-graph`
when structure does not help. Search does no Git work unless provenance is
requested. Use `--history --repo <repository>` for optional recent per-note
provenance or `--require-history --repo <repository>` when the task cannot
proceed with a partial Git lane. `--no-history` remains an explicit compatibility
form. Graph neighbors and Git history remain separate from primary
text rank. They explain and expand candidates without becoming authored facts,
links, or recency boosts.

Reranking is opt-in through `--rerank typesafe`. It uses `jev-1.13.0` and sends
the query plus each candidate's identifier, title, vault-relative path, and at
most 512 UTF-8 bytes of snippet text to TypeSafe. Enable it only for vaults
approved for external processing and provider input-token charges. Use
`--rerank-limit 25` to bound the window (2–25 candidates); four requests run
concurrently under one eight-second deadline with no retries. Exact identities
remain first. Results retain their original scores and retrieval evidence.

The CLI reads `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, an explicit `TYPESAFE_API_KEY_FILE`, or the
owner-only file `~/.config/wordcell/typesafe-api-key` (honoring
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`). Keep credentials outside the repository. A missing key or
provider failure retains baseline ordering and marks the rerank lane
unavailable or degraded. Inspect its structured `rerank` receipt for attempted
requests, known usage, elapsed time, and whether usage is complete; an unknown
charge is never reported as zero. A successful exit alone does not establish
that reranking occurred. Omit `--rerank` for local-only retrieval.

For a repository's ordinary KB searches, prefer its approved, pinned
`kb:search` script when present. That script declares the vault and processing
choice. Read returned notes before acting; model probabilities are ranking
signals, not proof of truth. Explicit priority rules still run last.

`wordcell history <note>` returns the bounded commit history already associated with
one resolved note. `wordcell history search <query-or-path>` searches the bounded Git
projection directly and retains hashes, subjects, matched paths, co-change
paths, and incomplete-detail diagnostics. Git co-change is historical evidence,
not permission to write a scope or relationship.

## Reuse one snapshot in code mode

For several related queries, prefer one SDK session to repeated CLI process
startup:

```ts
import { openKnowledgeBase, packUntrustedSearchContext } from "@hraness/wordcell/sdk";

const kb = await openKnowledgeBase({ root: "kb", repository: "." });
try {
  const result = await kb.search({
    query: "why browser capture uses the current tab",
    graph: { depth: 1 },
    history: "auto",
  });
  console.log(packUntrustedSearchContext(result).content);
} finally {
  await kb.close();
}
```

`grep`, `list`, `read`, `links`, `backlinks`, `search`, `history`, and
`searchHistory` share one confined read-only scan. QMD and Git initialize
lazily. The session does not watch Markdown or repository changes. Close it
before a write and open a new session after the final refresh and check.

Pass only ordinary plain objects and arrays from Wordcell or parsed JSON into
`packUntrustedSearchContext`. A same-realm JavaScript `Proxy` is executable
code, not inert data; isolate or serialize it before projection.

When independent queries can run concurrently, compose them with
`defineWorkflow` and `runWorkflow` or import a packaged workflow. The runner
validates a finite acyclic graph, caps global concurrency, serializes QMD nodes,
and keeps Git concurrency bounded. Do not bypass those resource groups with
unbounded `Promise.all` calls. Custom workflows use the staged
`defineWorkflow<Input>("id").node(...).output(...)` builder so dependency
results and the final output remain typed.

## Use focused structural views

`wordcell graph --json` returns the current resolved wikilinks, typed relationships,
diagnostics, and note-level connection counts without creating a second graph
store. Use it when a question spans the vault. Prefer `wordcell relation list`,
`wordcell backlinks`, or `wordcell links` when a known note gives you a narrower starting
point.

`wordcell links` is cycle-safe and requires an explicit traversal depth and result
limit. `wordcell relation list` separates authored outbound assertions from derived
inbound relationships while retaining canonical note IDs and source
provenance. Open the returned Markdown before treating an edge as correct: a
typed relationship records an authored assertion, not proof.

If a structural question is not covered by a named command, inspect the
bounded JSON graph in the agent or a short task-local script. Do not create or
commit a parallel graph database merely to answer one query. A recurring query
is evidence for a focused, tested command with an explicit output contract.

## Combine meaning with structure

1. For a repository-path question, use `wordcell context` before broader retrieval.
2. Use default hybrid search to discover candidate identities when exact
   structure does not answer the question. Read its lane evidence and partial
   diagnostics before relying on the order.
3. Use `wordcell list` to narrow by authored metadata such as `type`, `status`,
   `area`, or `tags`.
4. Use `wordcell links` at depth 1 to inspect immediate explicit relationships and
   `wordcell backlinks` for a focused inbound view. Increase depth only when the
   first neighborhood is insufficient. Traversal defaults to 50 notes and
   reports truncation; lower `--limit` for tighter agent context or raise it
   deliberately when a high-degree hub is genuinely relevant.
5. Use `wordcell graph --json` only when the question genuinely spans multiple
   neighborhoods; keep one-off processing task-local.
6. Read the authoritative notes and cited captures before synthesizing.

A title match may identify a prerequisite, prior version, or supporting note
rather than the artifact that owns the current outcome. Confirm status and
ownership in the candidate Markdown before answering or editing it.

Do not infer an edge from semantic similarity, or a conclusion from a tag. Do
not write generated backlink sections into notes. If the query exposes stale
metadata or a broken link, repair the authored Markdown and finish with
`wordcell refresh --root "$KB_ROOT"` and `wordcell check --root "$KB_ROOT"`.
Close any open SDK session before that repair and reopen it after validation.

An authored `index.md` may declare `kb_catalog: authored`; refresh and check
then leave it untouched. `wordcell catalog --root "$KB_ROOT"` renders the exhaustive
inventory on demand. A managed vault keeps the original generated-catalog
behavior. Neither mode changes scanning, graph analysis, semantic indexing, or
attachment validation.

## Query named graph programs

Use `wordcell graph query --program backlinks --note <exact-id> --root "$KB_ROOT" --json` for positive source proofs. Programs also include bounded `reachability`, predicate-specific `relation-closure`, exact `scope-route`, `shared-tags`, and `shared-concepts`. Default queries write nothing. `graph rebuild` writes only the disposable `.wordcell/oh.sqlite` cache; `graph verify` and queries with `--persisted` reject missing or stale state without repairing it. After a damaged cache, `graph rebuild --fresh` builds a replacement from Markdown.

Inspect the source revision, row/proof truncation and source record digests. Reopen SDK sessions after Markdown changes. Proofs establish derivation from source records, not the truth of an authored assertion. `wordcell graph --json` keeps its existing structural report.
