# Working in a hraness/wordcell vault

This guide gives coding agents a conservative workflow for reading and
maintaining a vault. Markdown is the durable record. Tool output, catalogs,
backlinks, traversed paths, semantic indexes, and percolation candidates are
views over that record.

## Customize before preparing a runtime

When the request is to set up or evolve a Wordcell, design the boundary before
discovering or installing the CLI. Inspect the explicitly proposed repository
and vault location without mutation. A new location does not need an existing
`index.md`. Interview the user about the recurring questions the Wordcell should
answer, then present the exact read and write targets in a proposal.

The approved proposal may choose the standard Markdown layout, no change, or
zero to three companion skills for recurring rituals. A companion skill must
name its inputs, surfaces, authority, approval boundary, durable outputs,
idempotence, failure behavior, and verification. Skill discovery and ambient
application or account sessions grant no authority. A changed target,
repository, skill, account, or integration requires renewed approval.

After approval, scaffold only the allowlisted paths. Matching existing bytes
are a no-op. Stop on divergent content, path escape, a symbolic link, partial
failure, or an unapproved external surface. Prepare the runtime only when the
approved operation needs it. Installation never authorizes initialization,
indexing, QMD state, account access, or vault mutation.

## Orient before editing

1. For a repository-path question, run `wordcell context`, read the returned
   `AGENTS.md` files from root to nearest, and inspect its bounded current-memory
   groups before opening optional hubs or running a broad search.
2. Read `index.md`, then search filenames, frontmatter titles, aliases, and note
   text before creating a new identity.
3. Read the notes that already own the concept or source in question.
4. Use the narrowest view that answers the question:
   - `wordcell list` for exact frontmatter or tag filters.
   - `wordcell links <note>`, `wordcell backlinks <note>`, or `wordcell relation list <note>` for authored relationships.
   - `wordcell history` for direct note or repository-path provenance.
   - `wordcell search` for a fused exact, full-text, and semantic view with visible evidence.
   - `wordcell graph` for whole-vault diagnostics.

Update an existing note when the identity is unambiguous. Create a new note when the subject has a distinct durable identity, not merely because a search phrase differs.

## Load repository context by path

When the question concerns a repository file or directory, start from the
repository root:

```sh
wordcell context src/index.ts --root kb --repo .
```

The command lists inherited guides from the repository root toward the nearest
scope, verified Wordcell hubs from the nearest scope back toward the root, and
authored records whose exact `repository_scopes` declaration contains the
target. It keeps maintained knowledge, active plans, dated research, reports,
and terminal plans in separate bounded groups. Every record reports why it
matched and whether its declared path exists. It prints summaries, not bodies.
Read every returned guide; they are the normative, always-loaded source for
ownership, required commands, prohibitions, invariants, and edit gates. Open
only the records whose summaries apply, then expand through a bounded command:

```sh
wordcell links scopes/src--25a6634263c1 --root kb --depth 1 --limit 25
wordcell backlinks scopes/src--25a6634263c1 --root kb
wordcell list --root kb --scope src --where area=source --json
wordcell search "why source errors retain source ranges" --root kb --scope src --json
```

Use the exact hub ID returned by `wordcell context`. Use `--kind file` or
`--kind directory` when a missing path cannot be classified reliably by
`--kind auto`.

A mapped scope hub carries pull-based rationale, history, examples, evidence,
and links. It cannot override its guide or become the only home of a
load-bearing edit rule. A guide does not need a hub.

Add `repository_scopes` to a plan, maintained note, dated research record, or
report when that record explains work under specific code paths:

```yaml
repository_scopes:
  - src/parser
  - tests/parser.test.ts
```

Use exact canonical repository-relative paths without globs. Directory scopes
match descendants, while file scopes match only that file. Future paths are
valid and appear as absent until created. Update active or maintained records
when code moves; preserve retired paths on terminal plans when they remain
useful history.

Path-context research is a dated snapshot, not a generic note with a date. Put
it under `projects/<domain>/market/` with `type: market-research`, `status:
snapshot`, and a valid `as_of` date. A path-context report declares `type:
report` and a valid `generated` date. Both need `repository_scopes`; other
records remain searchable without appearing in those current-memory groups.

## Query before reading broadly

Use typed metadata for exact selection and sorting:

```sh
wordcell list --where type=plan --where status=in-progress --sort metadata.updated --order desc
wordcell list --tag retrieval --scope packages/kb --sort inbound --order desc --json
```

Filters can address nested fields with dotted paths. Repeat `--where`, `--has`, or `--tag` to require every condition. Unquoted `true`, `false`, `null`, and numeric values are typed; retain inner quotes to select a string with the same spelling, as in `--where 'external_id="9007199254740993"'`. JSON output includes the live metadata, tags, backlinks, and inbound and outbound contextual counts for each result.

Use bounded traversal to understand explicit context around a note:

```sh
wordcell links plans/improve-ingestion --direction both --depth 2 --limit 25
```

Traversal defaults to at most 50 notes and reports when either the node or
combined-connection cap truncates a high-degree neighborhood. Lower the limit
for agent context discipline; raise it deliberately when the structural
question requires a wider view.

Use the whole-vault graph only when the question spans several note
neighborhoods:

```sh
wordcell graph --root . --json
```

The report is rebuilt from current Markdown and returns canonical note IDs,
resolved wikilinks, typed relationships, and diagnostics. Prefer `wordcell links`,
`wordcell backlinks`, or `wordcell relation list` when a known note provides a narrower
starting point. Open returned notes and inspect edge provenance before treating
a relationship as supported. If a recurring structural question is awkward to
answer from the JSON report, add a focused command with a bounded contract
rather than a second graph store.

Use hybrid search for broad recall while preserving exact evidence:

```sh
wordcell search "capturing a signed-in virtualized page"
wordcell search "capture" --tag ingestion --where status=accepted
wordcell search "notes/write-path" --mode exact
wordcell search "browser profile" --mode keyword
```

The default combines a live exact scan with QMD's local full-text and compact
embedding rankings, then reports each lane's evidence. It skips query expansion
and reranking models. The first hybrid or semantic query downloads the embedding
model and builds a local cache; subsequent queries incrementally index changed
Markdown. Wordcell validates a bounded immutable Markdown projection before QMD
indexes it. Shared-database mutations are serialized across local agent
processes, same-generation readers can overlap, and a projection change waits
for older readers to close. `wordcell index` can prewarm that cache. `--mode exact`
requires no model.

Reranking is opt-in through `--rerank typesafe`, which needs `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`.
This hosted lane sends the effective query and, for each of at most 25
candidates, its title, vault-relative path, and at most 512 UTF-8 bytes of
snippet text to TypeSafe in a separate request. Those fields leave the local
machine and may contain private vault material, so enable the lane only when
that external processing and its possible per-request cost are acceptable.
The engine re-sorts the bounded window with an independent relevance
probability per note; reranked hits keep their fused scores and gain a separate
`rerank` evidence lane. When the key is absent or the provider fails, the
search keeps the baseline order and reports a degraded or unavailable lane
instead of failing.

Graph neighbors and Git provenance are returned separately from the primary
rank. Use `--related <note>` to seed a bounded explicit neighborhood,
`--no-graph` when it is unnecessary, and `--history` when recent note
provenance helps. Omitted history performs no Git work. Use `--require-history`
when a result without Git provenance is not usable; the command then fails
instead of returning an unavailable or incomplete Git lane. Automatic history
keeps normal commits usable when one
commit exceeds its changed-path detail limit. The affected note retains that
commit's identity and vault-local association, while diagnostics and packed
context identify the incomplete co-change evidence. These views explain a
result; they do not create links or establish that a claim is correct.

Ask Git directly when text retrieval is unnecessary:

```sh
wordcell history notes/write-path --root kb --repo . --json
wordcell history search src/parser.ts --root kb --repo . --json
```

The second command searches bounded commit subjects, note paths, and co-change
paths. Co-change is evidence of historical association, not causation, and it
never writes repository scopes or graph edges.

For several related operations, open one read-only SDK session and reuse its
single vault scan:

```ts
import { openKnowledgeBase } from "@hraness/wordcell/sdk";

const kb = await openKnowledgeBase({ root: "kb", repository: "." });
try {
  const plans = kb.list({
    filters: [{ kind: "equals", path: "type", value: "plan" }],
  });
  const context = await kb.search({
    query: "current ingestion plan",
    history: "auto",
  });
  const source = kb.read(context.results[0]?.id ?? plans[0]?.id ?? "index");
  console.log(source.content);
} finally {
  await kb.close();
}
```

The session does not watch the filesystem. Close and reopen it after any note
write, authoring command, capture, refresh, or Git update that should appear in
later results. Use the bounded `defineWorkflow` and `runWorkflow` API when
independent retrieval branches can run concurrently; QMD work remains
serialized by default. Import `decisionContextWorkflow`,
`explainChangeWorkflow`, or `planRadarWorkflow` from `@hraness/wordcell/workflows`
when one of those common DAGs matches the task.

`decisionContextWorkflow` returns a bounded untrusted context envelope.
`explainChangeWorkflow` and `planRadarWorkflow` return raw Wordcell and Git result
objects for application-side inspection; their source-derived strings remain
untrusted data. Never execute those fields or insert them into an instruction
channel. Select and project the needed fields through
`packUntrustedSearchContext` or `@hraness/wordcell/untrusted-content` before an agent
handoff.

Use `history: "required"` when provenance is mandatory, or
`history: { policy: "required", noteLimit: 5 }` when the same requirement needs
custom bounds. Custom workflows use a staged builder so every node sees a typed
Wordcell session and only its declared dependency results:

```ts
import { openKnowledgeBase } from "@hraness/wordcell/sdk";
import { defineWorkflow, runWorkflow } from "@hraness/wordcell/workflow";

type Input = { readonly query: string };

const kb = await openKnowledgeBase({ root: "kb", repository: "." });
const research = defineWorkflow<Input>("research")
  .node({
    id: "search",
    resource: "qmd",
    run: ({ input, kb }) => kb.search({ query: input.query }),
  })
  .node({
    id: "pack",
    needs: ["search"],
    run: ({ result }) => result("search").results.map(({ path }) => path),
  })
  .output("pack");

const execution = await runWorkflow(research, {
  kb,
  input: { query: "current ingestion plan" },
});
console.log(execution.output);
await kb.close();
```

## Evaluate retrieval changes on a frozen corpus

Use a versioned evaluation manifest when a ranking, filter, graph, context, or
history change needs empirical evidence. Author query prose, structured lane
inputs, and 0–3 relevance judgments before inspecting the candidate run. Keep
development and test queries distinct.

```sh
wordcell evaluate kb/evaluations/repository-memory-v1.json \
  --root kb --repo . --split test \
  --model-file /path/to/the/recommended-model.gguf \
  --cache-state warm --json > kb/reports/repository-memory-v1.json
```

The command verifies the manifest's exact Git commit and vault tree and rejects
dirty vault content before opening retrieval. It runs the selected built-in
exact, keyword, semantic, hybrid, metadata, graph, path-context, and Git
adapters through one bounded snapshot. Use repeated `--retriever` values for an
ablation. Semantic and hybrid runs verify the file against the pinned model
SHA-256, give those exact bytes to QMD, and verify them again after retrieval.
The report retains the stable model URI, revision, and digest without storing
the local path.

Read per-query rankings, unavailable or degraded lanes, timings, raw resource
counters, per-class metrics, and paired intervals together. A small frozen
corpus is a regression and harness proof. It is not evidence about another
vault, machine, scale, cache state, or end-to-end agent outcome.

## Preserve authority boundaries

- Captured articles preserve what the source said and how it was acquired. Put later interpretation in a maintained note.
- Riffs preserve the speaker's first-person claims and uncertainty. Clean transcription noise without converting the riff into an essay by someone else.
- Maintained notes own synthesis, comparison, and current understanding.
- Plans own proposed work, decisions, execution state, and verification evidence.

Do not silently rewrite a capture to match a later conclusion. Link the source to the maintained interpretation instead.

## Grow durable plans

Before creating a plan, use `wordcell list --where type=plan` and search the vault for an existing artifact that owns the outcome. Prefer extending that file to creating a parallel progress log.

A durable plan records an observable outcome, context, scope and non-goals,
constraints, decisions, dependency-ordered work, verification, and recovery.
Keep its frontmatter easy to query, including `type: plan`, a description, an
area, applicable `repository_scopes`, and one status from `proposed`,
`accepted`, `in-progress`, `blocked`, `completed`, `superseded`, or `cancelled`.
Add dated findings, decisions, review evidence, and the final result to the same
file as the work develops. Before setting a terminal status, fill `## Result`
and `## Durable memory`: link each reusable conclusion to the maintained note,
guide, documentation, or checked code contract that now owns it, or state that
no durable promotion was needed.

The packaged `wordcell` Agent Skill routes plan requests to the complete authoring workflow. It treats a plan as a growing implementation record, not a disposable checklist or a directory of satellite status documents.

## Link for meaning

Use vault-root wikilinks without `.md`, for example:

```md
The capture strategy follows [[notes/bounded-acquisition|bounded acquisition]] so incomplete threads remain visible as incomplete.
```

Use ordinary Markdown links for external URLs. Add an internal link where the relationship helps a reader understand the sentence. Do not add bare reciprocal links, manufactured `Related` lists, or links whose only purpose is to improve graph counts.

Backlinks are derived from explicit wikilinks. Never paste generated backlink sections into notes. Catalog links in `index.md` are navigation and do not establish contextual relationships. Mention candidates are prompts for review, not instructions to edit.

Promote a reusable idea into an ordinary concept note:

```sh
wordcell note create notes/local-first --title "Local-first" --type concept --tag architecture
```

Author a typed relationship from the note that owns the assertion:

```sh
wordcell relation add notes/write-path supports notes/durable-agent-memory
```

Predicates use lower-kebab-case and targets use exact vault-root IDs without
`.md`. Recommended predicates for common Wordcell claims are `synthesizes`,
`evidenced-by`, `informed-by`, `supersedes`, and `contradicts`. The list is
advisory; a vault may use another canonical predicate whose meaning its prose
establishes. Explain the assertion in prose or evidence. Do not author inverse,
reciprocal, transitive, or similarity-derived edges. External or unclassified
material does not gain a relationship automatically.

## Capture a source

Check the local environment and the installed adapters before relying on optional capabilities:

```sh
wordcell doctor
wordcell adapters
```

Inspect an unfamiliar source before writing it:

```sh
wordcell inspect https://example.com/article
wordcell inspect https://example.com/article --json
```

Capture a URL or the page already open in the signed-in browser:

```sh
wordcell clip https://example.com/article --output articles
wordcell clip current --browser-live --output articles
```

Review the Markdown and `capture.json` together. Preserve the recorded status, warnings, counts, acquisition attempts, and artifact outcomes. `partial` is a useful result, not a defect to hide. Do not infer thread completeness from visible prose alone.

The capture command reads content and writes a local bundle. It does not post, like, follow, send, delete, or submit on the source service.

Capture a local or public remote PDF through its separate ingestion path:

```sh
wordcell pdf "/absolute/path/to/document.pdf" --output articles
wordcell pdf "https://example.com/document.pdf" --output articles
```

Review native headings, OCR-derived text, and retained source images together.
The bundle keeps `source.pdf` byte-for-byte and never records its original
absolute path. A text-bearing screenshot still needs its source-image
reference; a useful native-text result does not hide an unprocessed image or
page.

Use the source inbox to find recent captures that have not yet been linked from
maintained knowledge:

```sh
wordcell inbox --root kb --limit 25 --json
```

The inbox is advisory. A source can remain an intentional leaf; review it and
record a disposition only when it changes maintained understanding.

## Finish every change

After adding, renaming, moving, or materially revising notes:

```sh
wordcell percolate "<changed-note-id>" --root . --limit 25 --json
wordcell refresh --root .
wordcell graph --root .
wordcell check --root .
```

Any code-mode session opened before those writes is now stale. Close it before
the write and open a new session after the final check.

Open the evidence cited by each percolation candidate. Promote only concepts
likely to be reused and relationships established by the source material.
In Percolation Result V2, a missing relationship is an unordered endpoint pair
with a required predicate. It does not choose a source, direction, or
`related-to` fallback. Read both endpoints and author the directed assertion
only when their prose and evidence establish it. Parse historical unversioned
V1 results explicitly; do not silently transform their suggested predicate
into a V2 claim.
Review broken and ambiguous links, typed relationships, local attachments, and
repository-scope advisories first. Then inspect orphans and high-confidence
title or alias mentions in context. Add a suggested link only when it improves
the prose. Finish with a clean `wordcell check`. In a managed vault, inspect the
catalog diff; in an authored vault, refresh leaves the front door unchanged and
`wordcell catalog --root .` provides an exhaustive disposable inventory.

When multiple agents are editing different notes, each lane runs:

```sh
wordcell check --root . --no-catalog
```

The integrating agent runs one final refresh and normal check after the lanes
join. Managed vaults serialize their one catalog write. Authored vaults declare
`kb_catalog: authored` in `index.md` and avoid that write entirely. No shared
graph database or generated fact log exists to contend on.

If the change adds, removes, renames, or moves a scope hub, changes its
`type` or `scope`, or edits an `kb:context` marker, also run:

```sh
wordcell agents identity packages/parser --json
wordcell agents check --root kb --repo .
```

Use `wordcell agents identity` when creating or moving a mapping; it derives the
canonical path and marker without writing either file. The gate checks
canonical content-derived IDs, exact repository-relative
scopes, collisions, real confined scope directories and guide files, guide
shape, and reciprocal markers. A scope move changes identity, so rename the hub
and marker together. Unmapped `AGENTS.md` files are valid.

Use the audit when reviewing instruction size or inheritance:

```sh
wordcell agents audit --root kb --repo .
wordcell agents audit --root kb --repo . --json
```

The audit adds deterministic per-guide and per-section measurements,
inherited-chain totals, long-bullet advisories, and exact duplicate-rule
advisories. Inspect them as refactoring leads. Length is not correctness, and a
rule that must be known before editing stays in `AGENTS.md` even when it is
long. Guide discovery skips common generated and vendor directories and never
follows symbolic-link directories.
