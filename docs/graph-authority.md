# Query the derived graph

Wordcell's named graph programs use its pinned immutable Oh release.
Markdown is authoritative. Queries never add links or inferred
relationships to notes, and the existing `wordcell graph --json` report keeps
its format.

Wordcell 0.22.4 pins Oh 0.12.0. Earlier Wordcell 0.22.1 used Oh 0.11.0.
The graph contracts stay compatible and existing vaults need no migration.

## How Wordcell and Oh fit together

Wordcell owns the Markdown knowledge base: authoring, capture, search,
repository context, and publishing. [Oh](https://oh.computer) is the embedded
memory framework that evaluates Wordcell's named graph queries and carries
their source proofs. No Oh account or separate service is required.

| Layer | Role | Authority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Markdown and Git | Note text, frontmatter, authored relationships, and history. | The record you own and edit. |
| Wordcell | Reads a bounded vault snapshot, resolves links, and prepares named queries. | Current files determine the graph facts. |
| Oh | Evaluates the derived graph and returns bounded proofs. | A replaceable projection of those facts. |

For example, a backlinks query returns the note that authored a link, the linked
note, and the source line. Its proof identifies that source note's content
digest and the exact projection revision. Editing a note changes the snapshot;
open a new session to query the new record. A query never writes the relationship
back into a note.

After the [quick start](getting-started.md) has created `notes/parser-contract`,
save a second note with one authored link and query its backlink:

```sh
wordcell note create notes/retry-review --title "Retry review" --type concept --body "Use [[notes/parser-contract]] when changing retry behavior." --root kb
wordcell graph query --program backlinks --note notes/parser-contract --root kb --json
```

The returned `source` is `notes/retry-review` and the `target` is
`notes/parser-contract`. Their proof follows the link you wrote. This uses an
in-memory projection and creates no `.wordcell/oh.sqlite` file.

Wordcell search uses its own exact matching and optional QMD local retrieval.
Optional Jev reranking reorders a bounded candidate window through a hosted
provider. These search paths do not invoke Oh's conversation-memory retrieval
API. Oh's memory benchmarks therefore do not measure Wordcell search or answer
quality. See Wordcell's [retrieval study](reranking.md#evidence-and-limits) and
[context-payload measurement](evidence.md) for the paths evaluated here.

The graph engine prefers the bundled Rust implementation automatically when
available and retains the TypeScript fallback. Choosing an engine requires no
experimental mode. The source revision, proof limits, and disposable-cache
boundary are the same in either case.

## Query without creating a cache

Use an exact extensionless note ID. The default query creates an in-memory
projection of a complete bounded Markdown snapshot and closes it afterward.

```sh
wordcell graph query --program backlinks --note notes/design --root kb --json
wordcell graph query --program reachability --note notes/design --depth 3 --root kb --json
wordcell graph query --program relation-closure --note notes/design --predicate depends-on --depth 3 --root kb --json
wordcell graph query --program scope-route --scope src --root kb --json
```

| Program | Returned columns | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `backlinks` | `source`, `target`, `line`, `kind`, `predicate` | Incoming resolved contextual links and local typed relationships. |
| `reachability` | `source`, `target`, `depth` | Positive contextual and typed paths of lengths 1 through the requested depth. |
| `relation-closure` | `source`, `target`, `depth` | Positive local relationship paths using one exact predicate. |
| `scope-route` | `note`, `scope` | Exact authored `repository_scopes` declarations. |
| `shared-tags` | `note`, `other`, `tag` | Positive tag evidence shared with another note. |
| `shared-concepts` | `note`, `other`, `concept` | Positive evidence that two ordinary notes connect to the same concept, in either direction. |

Depth defaults to 3 and is bounded at 8. A cyclic path may return its starting
note; the same target at different lengths is a different row. External
`kb://` relationship targets remain external facts and never enter local path
closure. Broken and ambiguous links remain diagnostics in the existing graph
report. The configured catalog is excluded from graph relationships.

There is no arbitrary Datalog text evaluator. These reviewed named programs
use positive rules. Wordcell computes absence, orphans and counts from a
complete snapshot; an Oh proof does not prove that an authored claim is true.

## Rebuild and verify local state

```sh
wordcell graph rebuild --root kb --json
wordcell graph verify --root kb --json
wordcell graph query --program backlinks --note notes/design --root kb --persisted --json
```

Only rebuild writes `.wordcell/oh.sqlite` and its self-ignoring cache directory.
It serializes local rebuilds, applies changed records and deletions in a private
staging database, verifies replay, rechecks the Markdown revision, and atomically
installs the result. A failed build leaves the previous database in place.
The operation never edits Markdown or initializes a vault.

Verification and `--persisted` queries read a bounded copy into memory. They
reject a missing, stale, foreign or corrupt cache; they do not repair it or
create files. SQLite sidecars and symbolic or hard links are refused. Close any
foreign writer before retrying. To rebuild a damaged disposable cache from
Markdown, explicitly request a fresh database:

```sh
wordcell graph rebuild --fresh --root kb --json
```

The previous file stays in place until its replacement passes verification.
A fresh rebuild also removes accumulated derived history. Oh supports atomic
record updates, but its query engine evaluates the complete projection after
an input change. Equal source snapshots produce equal rows and source proofs;
history-bound projection identities can differ after a fresh rebuild.
In-memory projections use a fixed synthetic genesis time so identical snapshots
can reproduce and verify their proof results across sessions. That logical time
is never evidence of when a note was authored or an operation occurred.

## Inspect proof and limit information

Each result identifies the vault, exact source revision, named request,
projection digest, evaluated limits, rows, and supporting proof trees. Fact
proofs name the source note, its content digest and its exact Oh record digest.
Derived proofs name the applied rule and its premises. A declared `document_id`
retains record identity across renames; notes without one use an explicit path
identity. Wordcell never invents or writes IDs. Invalid or duplicate stable IDs
and invalid scope metadata stop extraction.

The graph boundary accepts at most 4,000 Markdown notes, 100,000 facts, and
64 MiB of source text; individual query atoms are bounded at 16 KiB. Queries
also have explicit row, work, derived-tuple, round, result-byte and proof
budgets. `--limit` sets the row limit up to 1,000. SDK callers can reduce each
budget. Work exhaustion fails instead of claiming a complete answer. Row or
proof truncation is retained in JSON and yields CLI exit code 4. Inspect
`truncated`, `proofsTruncated`, and proof truncation nodes before using a result
as complete evidence.

```ts
import { openKnowledgeBase } from "@hraness/wordcell";
const kb = await openKnowledgeBase({ root: "kb" });
try {
  const result = await kb.graphQuery({
    program: "reachability", note: "notes/design", depth: 3,
    limits: { rows: 100, workUnits: 500_000 },
  });
  console.log(result.revision, result.rows);
  console.log(await kb.graphVerifyResult(result));
} finally {
  await kb.close();
}
```

A session intentionally retains one read-only snapshot. Reopen the session
when Markdown changes. `graphVerifyResult` re-evaluates a bounded result
against that session and rejects modified, foreign or stale evidence; it does
not authorize writing any fact into Markdown. The lower-level graph API is
available at `@hraness/wordcell/graph-authority`.

## Add positive proofs to percolation

```sh
wordcell percolate notes/design --proofs --root kb --json
```

This opt-in result has kind `wordcell.graph-percolation`. `suggestions` retains
the existing percolation V2 candidates. `positiveSupport` contains separate
shared-tag and shared-concept query results, each with its own limits and
proofs. Missing concepts, absent edges, support counts, and predicate selection
remain Wordcell or author decisions. A positive shared tag does not establish
that two notes need a relationship. Read the cited Markdown before editing.

SDK callers use `kb.percolateWithProofs({ note: "notes/design" })` or
`percolateWithGraph(snapshot, options)` from
`@hraness/wordcell/graph-percolation`. No proof operation writes notes.
